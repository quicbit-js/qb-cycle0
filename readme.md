# qb-cycle0

Find repeating series from the zeroth offset.  This is quote a different problem from pattern
searches which seek out the start of a pattern, "mu".  This algorithm just seeks the cycle from 
the zeroth position and it is both simple and efficient.  Useful for the type
of compression work that scans files with fixed patterns within subgroups.
